Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs. Usually, every few weeks, someone brings you a new, smaller box of pieces to add to your big set. That’s how normal Windows 10 works—it gets new features, colors, and apps constantly. 
Windows 10 LTSB (Long-Term Servicing Branch) is like having a perfectly built, special LEGO castle that you decide never to change. 
Here is the simple breakdown:
LTSB means "Long-Term" (It stays the same): Instead of getting new, confusing updates every few months, this version stays exactly how it is when you first get it for years. It is super stable, meaning it rarely crashes or breaks.
No Extra Toys: LTSB removes things like the Microsoft Store, Cortana (the talking helper), and the Edge internet browser. It only keeps the basic, important tools. It’s like a toy car that only drives forward, instead of one that flips, lights up, and makes noise.
Who uses it? It is not for your home computer or video games. It is for computers that do one very important job forever, like the computer inside an ATM machine, a self-checkout machine at the grocery store, or a robot in a factory.
Safe and Steady: Even though it doesn't get new toys, it still gets "security updates". Think of this like giving the computer a check-up to make sure no bad bugs get in, without changing how it looks or works. 
In short: Windows 10 LTSB is a "frozen" version of Windows that is very safe, very boring on purpose, and never changes, designed for machines that need to work perfectly every single time.
Its based on first version of windows 10*

LTSB/LTSC means Long-Term Servicing Windows. It’s real Windows made for important computers (like ATMs or machines) that must stay the same and not get new features. It only gets security fixes, no Store, no Cortana, no big updates.

Windows 10 LTSB 2015 is based on the first release of Windows 10 (version 1507 / “TH1”). That’s why it looks old, but it’s still genuine Windows 10, just frozen in time on purpose.

LSTC Or LTSB is a special edition of windows provided by Microsoft for important computers like ATMS or machines.
It doesn't have useless things.It is very fast & optimized.
